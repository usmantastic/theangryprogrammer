            <p >So I just finished the book Slaughterhouse Five. It is a darkly satirical novel which explains the real experiences of the author through WWII and his not-so-real time travels and visits to a planet named Tralfamadore.</p>

            <p>It is an excellent book which explains many things beautifully. It explains the horrors of wars, the permanent PTSDs of it, life after war with those permanent physical and psychological damages, it does an excellent job at explaining the thinking patterns of most of the old people; why do they stay disconnected with the world most of the time, why they act grumpy most of the time, what is it like to be old.</p>
            
            <p>I am of the opinion that the only people who want war are the ones who know nothing about it; other than of course the people who benefit in unimaginable magnitudes from it. This book just gave me a whole bunch of new reasons to loathe war.</p>
            
            <div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto; font-family: 'open sans', serif; font-size: 20px; line-height: 170%;">
                <p style="font-family: 'Raleway', serif;">“And Lot's wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been. But she did look back, and I love her for that, because it was so human. So she was turned into a pillar of salt. So it goes.”</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Kurt Vonnegut tells the stories of his capture, his ~10 day travel boxed up in a train without food with fellow americans, the story of their misery after they got out of the train. He tells stories about the candles that were made out of the fat of Russians; those Russians who had boiled innocent German schoolgirls in hot water. Vonnegut was then sent to Dresden to work as a war-slave where he notices the beauty of architecture of Dresden. He was assigned as a laborer in a slaughterhouse and was directed to ask for “Slaughterhouse-Five” if ever lost in the city. The memories of war are so horrific that years later, when Vonnegut is involved in a plane crash, he is found unconsciously mumbling “Slaughterhouse-Five, Slaughterhouse-Five”. He then goes on and tells the tail of the bombings on one of the most beautiful cities in the world; and how after that magnificent city was turned into ruins and millions were killed through air-raids, a man was shot for taking a kettle that was not his.</p>

            <p>The book also does a great job at explaining how old people think. How they get almost disconnected from the current affairs and regularly dose off to the past. It also mildly tells about the author’s trips to Tralfamadore, an imaginary planet where the author can escape all the unhappy moments of his life just by choosing not to go in that timeline, where he is paired with a hot 20-years-old softcore pornstar. An imaginary place where he could have achieved his deepest fantasies. A place where one could move across time in whatever direction and choose to only live the moments he adores, avoiding the ones he wishes he never would have experienced.</p>
        
            <p>Great book. I am glad I read it.</p>
