<h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Josefin Slab', serif; font-size: 40px;"><br><br>Book Review: Waqia Karbala, Chor Machaye Shor<br><br></h1>
    <div style="width:50%; margin:0 auto; font-family: 'open sans', serif; font-size: 20px; line-height: 170%;"> 
       <br>
        
            <p style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Josefin Slab', serif; font-size: 20px;"> Download the book here: [<a href="https://archive.org/download/KurtVonnegutSlaughterhouseFiveAudiobook/Waqia%20Karbala%20Chor%20Machaye%20Shor%20By%20Syed%20Amjad%20Hussain.pdf">PDF</a>]
        
            <p >Unlike most of the books related to religion, this book infers on the base of logic instead of belief. In this book, the author analyses everything logically and as a result, exposes Hussain. I won’t rate this book to be completely unbiased. There are times when the author becomes too nitpicky but it is surely magnitudes of times less biased than the conventional books on Waqia Karbala you find in the market. </p>

            <p>This book uncovers the realities of the reasons and happenings of the battle at Karbala, an incident which changed the history of the Islamic nation; for bad. </p>
            
            <p>The Khilafat of Ali failed. It never really was acknowledged by more than about half the Islamic world. The other half including many Sahabah was against it including the wife of Muhammad. Ali gave up the Khilafat (so much for Baab ul ilm) to Muavia. Muavia handled the Khilafat brilliantly and <em>used to send hefty presents to the family of Ali which the family happily accepted. The tradition continued even after the death of Muavia. Yazid used to send money to Hussain every year, used to pay his debts and used to fulfil his needs.</em></p>
            
            <p>As Muavia was getting older, someone advised him to make his son, Yazid, the next khalifa. He did not like the idea because that would make Islam a monarchy. What he did instead, he organized a meeting of hundreds of Sahabah and took a vote from them on whether Yazid should be the next khalifa. The vote went into Yazid’s favor by majority and after the death of Muavia, Yazid became the khalifa.</p>
        
            
              
            <p>Now let’s see whether or not Yazid deserved to be khalifa over Hussain. Yazid was an active polititian for a long time before he held the post of khilafat. Hussain had never held a notable post in his entire life. Yazid had proven himself to be a good politician, a good scholar and a good administrative before the group of sahabah chose him as the next khalifa. Hussain on the other hand, wanted khilafat on the base of his ancestry. He had nothing to show other than the fact that he was the grandchild of Muhammad and the saying of Muhammad that “Hassan and Hussain are the leaders of youngsters in Jannah”.</p>
            
            <p>After Yazid became the khalifah, Hussain did not want to acknowledge his khilafat by performing a baiat at his hand (as was the tradition) but when the government spokesman came to him, <em>Hussain said that he would do baiat in public the next day instead of in a closed room. Before the dawn, Hussain fled from Makkah to Madinah (yes, this is the grandchild of the prophet we are talking about)</em> At Makkah, Hussain stayed for 4 months and kept gathering the opposition that should turn the tables around and make him khalifah. After a while, letters in hundreds started coming from Koofa, stating that they would join Hussain in the battle and bring Yazid down. Hussain sent a man to verify those letters, the man went and verified that there are many people in Koofa that are willing to fight alongside Hussain and consider him to be the rightful khalifa.</p>
        
            <div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto; font-family: 'open sans', serif; font-size: 20px; line-height: 170%;">
                <p style="font-family: 'Raleway', serif;">Almost all of Hussain’s relatives advised him not to go against Yazid. There wasn’t a single Sahabi with Hussain. There were hundreds alive, even those who fought in Badr. </p>
            </div>
        
            <p>Hussain left for Koofah, only to realize after completing more than half the journey that his agent has been killed and there are no people to fight alongside him in Koofah. As Hussain approached Koofah with about 100 people alongside him loaded with weapons, he was approached by Saad, his close relative and spokesperson of the government asking him not to start a battle and instead recognize Yazid as the true khalifah.</p>
        
             <div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto; font-family: 'open sans', serif; font-size: 20px; line-height: 170%;">
                <p style="font-family: 'Raleway', serif;">Hussain agreed that he would go to Damishk (where the khalifah yazid was) and perform a baiat at his hand. Karbala is not in the way from Makkah to Koofah, Hussain was going from Koofah to Damishk to acknowledge yazid as the true khalifah.</p>
        </div>
        
            <p>As Hussain was on his way to Damishk, he was approached by a higher government personnel and was asked to do 2 things.
            
            
            <br><b>1:- Do a baiat at his hand in the name of Yazid to make sure Hussain does not repeat what he did before (saying that I will perform baiat the next day and then fleeing before dawn.)</b>
                
            <br><b>2:- Surrender the weapons to make sure they don’t start fights on their way.</b>
          
           <br> Both of these demands were logical especially when Hussain was apparently on his was to acknowledge Yazid as the true Khalifah. But Hussain did not agree to these conditions and warriors from Hussain’s group ambushed the government soldiers; as a result, the soldiers from the government attacked and killed the warriors in Hussain’s group. 18 people from Hussain’s group returned home, which shows that they were not attacked and killed blindly.
            After that, people from Hussain’s family had good relationships with people from Yazid’s family.
            </p>
        
            <div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto; font-family: 'open sans', serif; font-size: 20px; line-height: 170%;">
                <p style="font-family: 'Raleway', serif;">Bottomline: Hussain was a narcissist who considered himself to be the best among the people and the rightful person to be Khalifah, he was neither. He lied and fled when he was asked to perform a baiat and was killed when he tried to ambush a group of government soldiers. As a result, two groups formed in Islam who are fighting and killing each other still after more than a thousand years.</p>

            <p>I liked the book because it was logical, easy to read and debunked many myths for me.</p>
